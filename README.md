# program_with_dumbest_code
This is fun repository, where you can use dumb , weird logic in programs to get output.

Question 1 *Why i am created this repositary in first place ?? right !!
------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANSWER IS SIMPLE , I AM HERE FOR REVOLUTION , TO CREATE BIGGEST COMMUNITY OF CODER WHICH CAN WRITE CODE NOT CORRECT. BUT SUCH IN WEIRD WAY WHERE THEY CAN LEARN ABOUT PROGRAMMING AS WELL AS LEARN 
ABOUT LIMITATION OF PROGRAAMING IN FUN WAY THAT THEY LOVE.
EVERY ONE CAN WRITE SMART CODE  LOGIC FOR SPECIFIC OR PARTICULAR TYPE OF PROBLEM , BUT CAN YOU WRITE WEIRD CODE FOR PROBLEM BY IGNORING THE TIME AND SPACE COMPLEXITY 
I CAN HEAR BIG NO FROM YOUR SIDE..
BUT WHAT IF I CHALLENGE YOU TO WRITE 1 CODE OF YOUR CHOICE WITH WILDEST DUMB LOGIC.
YOU WILL THINK ABOUT PRETTY DUMB LOGIC, RIGHT! LIKE ME- PRINTING 10000 NUMBER MANUALLY NO LOOP AND ANYTHING. IT TAKES ME -  1 HOUR TO WRITE WHOLE CODE . YEAH 1 HOUR . 
YOU CAN CONRIBUTE TO MY REPOS BY JUST ADDING 1 LINE TO  1 BRANCH.
